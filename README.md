## Description of project
Quizzz is a game created with the purpose of raising the energy awareness of those who play while still being 
entertaining. It was made with javaFX as the tool for the GUI and spring as the backend framework. It has 
both Single Player and Multi Player modes so people can enjoy a friendly competition with their friends, both with 
jokers, difficulty and emojis. There are all-time leaderboards  so that the players can compare scores, and an Admin
Panel so people can edit/delete/create energy-Activities that will later be part of the game.
