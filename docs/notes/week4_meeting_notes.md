# Week 4 Meeting Notes

## Last Week Performance 
### What we did well

* Everyone handled the tasks assigned to them well
* We helped each other with activities
* Everyone passed information literacy
* It’s’ good that we’ve already started coding
* Dividing the tasks goes smoothly

### What could have been improved

* Don’t merge everything immediately after approval, let everyone see the changes and wait for all group members to see it and approve so everyone keeps the track of changes


## HCI assignment feedback

* Good overall, some small comments
* Demographics in the experts section
* Describe the prototype (for example how do the screen transitions work? )


## General notes
* Next week buddy check
* Florentin will make the development branch protected
* We will keep 2 approvals in case something urgent happens, but overall we should let everyone see the changes
* We should implement PUT endpoint anyways for some other functionalities anyways
* Write unit tests for api endpoints.
* * If we want to, we can try to learn mojito and use it in our project
* Let’s start testing sooner than on last weeks
* Design problem with colours is solved
* “In review” board is for us, not our TA
* Deadlines: 
* * HCI assignment
* * Information literacy 
* * Activities



## ToDo for this week
* Making all of the required classes, controlles, services
